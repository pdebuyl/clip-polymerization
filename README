# Command line interface project - polymerization

## Purpose

This project is intented to be a fully reproducible computational research
project.
The goal is to model polymerization kinetics in Molecular Dynamics in
ESPResSo++ and lammps.

All model computations can be run through the Makefile.

## Requirements

- Make
- [lammps](http://lammps.sandia.gov/)
